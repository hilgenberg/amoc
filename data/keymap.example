# This is the example keymap file for MOC.  You can define your own key
# bindings for MOC commands by creating your own keymap file and setting
# the 'Keymap' option in ~/.moc/config.
#
# The format of this file is:
#
#     - Lines beginning with # are comments.
#     - Blank lines are ignored.
#     - Every other line is expected to be in this format:
#
#           COMMAND = [KEY ...]
#
# The KEY can be:
#
#     - Just a char, like i, L, ", *
#     - CTRL-KEY sequence: ^k (CTRL-k), ^4
#     - ALT-KEY (meta) sequence: M-j (ALT-j), M-/
#     - Special keys: DOWN, UP
#                     LEFT, RIGHT
#                     HOME, END
#                     BACKSPACE
#                     INS, DEL
#                     ENTER
#                     PAGE_UP, PAGE_DOWN
#                     SPACE, TAB
#                     KEYPAD_CENTER
#                     ESCAPE
#                     F1 - F12
#
# Omitting the KEY for a COMMAND will unbind its default key.
# Later bindings override previous ones.
#
# Meta-key detection is sensitive to the ESCDELAY environment variable (see
# the manpage for ncurses(3)).  In its absence, MOC resets the default
# delay to 25ms.  If you need to emulate meta-key sequences using the ESC
# key, then you may need to set the value of ESCDELAY back to its ncurses
# default of 1000ms (but doing so will make the response to the ESC key
# sluggish).
#
# If MOC's keypresses are being filtered through some other program (in a
# GUI environment, for example) which also does meta-key detection, then
# MOC is at the mercy of the timings with which that program presents them.
#

#TODO:
# Executing external commands (1 - 10) invoked with key commands (F1 - F10
# by default).
#
# Some arguments are substituted before executing:
#
#     %f - file path
#     %i - title made from tags
#     %S - start block mark (in seconds)
#     %E - end block mark (in seconds)
#
# Data from tags can also be substituted:
#
#     %t - title
#     %a - album
#     %r - artist
#     %n - track
#     %m - time of the file (in seconds)
#
# The parameters above apply to the currently selected file.  If you change
# them to capital letters, they are taken from the file currently playing.
#
# Programs are run using execv(), not a shell, so you can't do things like
# redirecting the output to a file.  The command string is split using blank
# characters as separators; the first element is the command to be executed
# and the rest are its parameters, so if you use "echo Playing: %I" we run
# program 'echo' (from $PATH) with 2 parameters: the string 'Playing:' and
# the title of the file currently playing.  Even if the title contains
# spaces, it's still one parameter and it's safe if it contains `rm -rf /`.
#
# Examples:   ExecCommand1 = "cp %f /mnt/usb_drive"
#             ExecCommand2 = "/home/joe/now_playing %I"
